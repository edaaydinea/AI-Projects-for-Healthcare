## Projects in Bootcamp Education

- **[Breast Cancer Classification ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification/%20Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb):** The aim of this project is classification the tumors into malignant or benign with machine learning techniques.
- **[Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-ray using PyTorch ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blo/731619a7f8e041059d15832d56c1ca1df540a221/Detecting%20COVID-19%20with%20Chest%20X-Ray%20using%20PyTorch/Detecting%20COVID-19%20with%20Chest%20X-Ray%20using%20PyTorch.ipynb):** The aim of this project is detection
  COVID-19 on the chest x-ray images by using PyTorch. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) is taken from Kaggle.
- **[Diabetes Prediction with PySpark MLLIB ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/731619a7f8e041059d15832d56c1ca1df540a221/Diabetes%20Prediction%20With%20Pyspark%20MLLIB/Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to build logistic regression model using PySpark MLLIB
  to classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic. This project is a Guided project([Link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/diabetes-prediction-with-pyspark-mllib)) available on Coursera.
- **[Heart Failure Data Analysis ✅](https://jovian.ai/edaaydinea/health-failure-prediction):** The aim of this project is to make a detailed exploratory data analysis on the Heart Failure Prediction [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) which is taken from Kaggle by using the plotly library.
- **[Relationship between COVID-17 & Happiness in that Country ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/Relationship%20between%20COVID-19%20%20%26%20Happiness%20in%20that%20Country/covid19%20data%20analysis%20notebook.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to work on whether
  where is any relationship between the spread of the coronavirus in a country and how happy people are living in
  that country or not. The dataset is taken from COVID-19 dataset published by Johns Hopkins University and World
  Happiness Report.

## Projects in Healthcare + Artificial Intelligence Education

- **[DNA Classification Project ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/DNA%20Classification%20Project/DNA%20Classification.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to find out whether the DNA sequence is the promoter.
- **[Heart Disease Classification Project ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/Heart%20Disease%20Classification%20Project/Heart%20Disease%20Classification.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to predict  the condition of her/his disease throughout a classification algorithm based on a neural network. The dataset is taken from [UCI Machine learning Respiratory](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).
- **[Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease Project ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/Diagnosing%20Coronary%20Artery%20Disease%20Project/Diagnosing%20Coronary%20Artery%20Disease.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to predict the condition of her/his disease throughout a classification algorithm based on a neural network.
- **[Breast Cancer Detection ✅](https://github.com/edaaydinea/AI-Projects-for-Healthcare/blob/master/Breast%20Cancer%20Detection/Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb):** The aim of this project is to predict the breast cancer from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
