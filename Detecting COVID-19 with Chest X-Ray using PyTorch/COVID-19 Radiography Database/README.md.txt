*****COVID-19 CHEST X-RAY DATABASE


We have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. All the X-ray images will be released as soon as possible in Kaggle repository. In our current realease, there are 1143 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneuomonia images. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.  


**COVID-19 data:
-----------------------
COVID data are collected from different publicly accessible dataset, online sources and published papers.
-400 CXR images from another Github source[1].
-183 CXR images from a Germany medical school[2].
-560 CXR image from SIRM, Github, Kaggle & Tweeter[3,4,5]

***Normal and Viral Pneumonia images:
---------------------------------------- 
Normal and Viral Pneumonia data are collected from  the Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database [6]

***Contribution
    - We have developed the database of COVID-19 x-ray images from Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) COVID-19 DATABASE, Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset developed by Joseph Paul Cohen and Paul Morrison and Lan Dao in GitHub and images extracted from 43 different publications. References for each image is provided. Normal and Viral pneumonia images were adopted from Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database.   

***Formats
    - All the images are in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format and resolution are 1024*1024 pixels and 256*256 pixels, which can be easily converted to 224*224 or 227*227 pixels typically required by the popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

****Objective
    -  Researchers can use this database to produce useful and impactful scholarly work on COVID-19, which can help in tackling this pandemic.
